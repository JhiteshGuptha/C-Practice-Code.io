1. Sum of Numbers

Use a for loop to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (user input).

2. Factorial with while

Compute the factorial of a number using a while loop.

3. Reverse Digits with do-while

Reverse the digits of a number (e.g., 123 → 321) using a do-while loop.

4. Skip Even Numbers

Print numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop but skip even numbers using continue.

5. Nested for Loop Pattern

Print a pyramid pattern using nested for loops:

  *  
 ***  
*****  

6. Break on Negative Input 

Use a while loop to read integers until a negative number is entered. 
Exit the loop with break.  

7. Multiplication Table  

Print a 5x5 multiplication table using nested for loops.  

8. Prime Check with for Loop 

Check if a number is prime using a for loop (without using functions/arrays).  

9. Sum of Digits with do-while  

Calculate the sum of digits of a number (e.g., 123 → 6) using a do-while loop.  

10. Continue in Nested Loop

Print numbers 1–10 using nested loops (outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns) 
but skip printing 5 using continue.
