1. Basic Arithmetic Expression

Calculate and print the result of (15 % 4) * 3 + 12 / 2 using appropriate operators.

2. Compound Assignment

Declare int x = 5. Update x using +=, *=, and -= operators in sequence (e.g., x += 3; x *= 2; x -= 4;).
Print the final value.

3. Logical AND/OR

Given a = 7, b = 3, and c = 5, evaluate and print the result of (a > b) && (c <= a) || (b != c).

4. Operator Precedence

Compute and print the value of 5 + 3 * 2 / 4 - 1 without using parentheses. 
Explain how precedence rules apply.

5. Comparison Chain

Check if 10 < 15 and 15 <= 15 are both true using logical operators. 
Print the result.

6. Modulo and Division

Calculate the remainder when 27 is divided by 4, then divide the result by 2. 
Print the final value.

7. Boolean Negation

Declare int flag = 0. Use the logical NOT operator to print the inverse of flag.

8. Mixed-Type Assignment

Declare float y = 4.5. Update y using y *= 2 and y -= 3, then print the result.

9. Complex Expression

Evaluate (2 + 3) * 4 == 20 || 10 / 3 != 3 and print the boolean result.

10. Precedence Challenge

Compute ! (5 > 3 && 2 < 4) || (6 % 4 == 2) and explain the order of operations used.
