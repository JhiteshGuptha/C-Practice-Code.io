1. Single Integer Input

Write a program to read an integer using scanf() and print it.

2. Multiple Inputs in One Line

Read three integers in a single scanf() statement (e.g., input: 10 20 30) and print them.

3. Mixed Data Types

Use scanf() to read an integer, a float, and a character in one line (e.g., 25 3.14 A) and display them.

4. Reading a String

Declare a character array of size 50.
Use scanf() to read a single-word string (no spaces) and print it.

5. Handling Characters with getchar()

Read three characters sequentially using getchar() and print them in reverse order.

6. Combining scanf() and getchar()

Read an integer using scanf(), then use getchar() to read a character immediately afterward. 
Print both values.

7. Formatted Date Input

Read a date in the format DD/MM/YYYY using scanf().
Print it as Day: DD, Month: MM, Year: YYYY.

8. Clearing the Input Buffer

After using scanf() to read an integer
Use getchar() to clear any leftover characters (like \n) before reading a character with getchar().

9. Reading a Sentence

Use scanf() to read a sentence with spaces (e.g., Hello World) using the format specifier %[^\n] and print it.

10. Multiple Inputs with Fixed Format

Read input in the format Name:ABC Age:20 using scanf() (assume "ABC" is a 3-letter name and "20" is an integer).
Print the values.
