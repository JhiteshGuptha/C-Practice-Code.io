1. Basic if-else

Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using if-else.

2. else if Ladder

Read a temperature value and print:

"Freezing" if ≤ 0°C

"Cold" if 1–15°C

"Warm" if 16–30°C

"Hot" if > 30°C

3. Nested if-else

Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using nested if-else.

4. Ternary Operator (Shorthand if)

Use the ternary operator to find the maximum of two numbers.

5. Ternary for Even/Odd

Rewrite the even/odd check from Question 1 using the ternary operator.

6. switch for Arithmetic Operations

Use switch to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on a character input (+, -, *, /).

7. switch with Characters

Read a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) and print its uppercase version using switch. Handle invalid inputs with a default case.

8. Combined if-else and switch

Check if a year is a leap year using if-else, then use switch to print "Leap" or "Not Leap".

9. Ternary for Sign Check

Use the ternary operator to print "Positive" or "Non-positive" for a given number.

10. Complex switch with Ranges

Use switch to categorize a score (0–100):

90–100: Grade A

80–89: Grade B

70–79: Grade C

Fail otherwise
